The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, growing up to 100 feet in length and weighing around 200 tons. It has a long, streamlined body, with a bluish-gray color that gives it its name. Blue whales are known for their distinctive songs, which can travel for long distances underwater. They are filter feeders, consuming vast amounts of tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill. Despite their enormous size, blue whales primarily feed on these small organisms. Unfortunately, they are also an endangered species due to factors such as habitat loss and hunting. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these magnificent creatures.
